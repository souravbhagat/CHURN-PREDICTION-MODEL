# CUSTOMER CHURN-PREDICTION-MODEL USING DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS
#### The purpose of this project was to develop a model that would be able to determine churning clients from a telecom company, as efficiently as possible.
#### Being able to identify potential churners in advance allows the company to develop strategies to prevent customers from leaving the client base. With this data in hand,   companies can offer incentives, like discounts or loyalty programs, or provide additional services in an attempt to reduce the churn rate.
